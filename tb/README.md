# Testbenches

This directory contains Verilog and SystemVerilog testbenches for verifying RTL modules.

- Each block/module should have a corresponding testbench here.
- Use open-source simulators like Icarus Verilog or commercial tools like ModelSim/Vivado for simulation.

Example:
- `fft_tb.v`: Testbench for FFT block
